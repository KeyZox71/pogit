## what is this all about ?

``sg`` is a git wrapper that aims for prettier and more easily readable commit messages.

It also helps you working with multiples remotes at once.

## features

  - a commit command, that will commit and add every files (be careful, for the moment this is a forced ``git add .``, this is not made for specific files commits)
  - you can push the repo, it will push on all the remotes availables
  - helpful help messages for the commands

upcomming features:
  - remote managing (why tho ? i don't see any addition i can give that the basic thing don't have)
  - init command to initialize a git repo
  - add support for subdirectories of the repo

## install

I'll make an installer later.

For the moment, move the ``sg`` somewhere that is in your ``PATH``, or add the folder where ``sg`` is located in your ``PATH``.

## license
