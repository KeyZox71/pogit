## what is this all about ?

sg is a git wrapper that aims for prettier and more easily readable commit messages.
It also helps you working with multiples remotes at once.

## features

  - at this state of the project it's just a readme and a program that display some help messages

upcomming features:
  - a commit command
  - remote managing
  - possibility to push the repo
  - init command to initialize a git repo
  - helpful help messages for the commands

## install

i'll make an installer when there will be an actual program, i won't do this for a script that just display some random help messages.

just move the ``sg`` somewhere that is in your ``PATH``, or add the folder where ``sg`` is located in your ``PATH``.
